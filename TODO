- implement logging (many targets, different levels)
- implement queue
- implement locking
- follow freedesktop.org's "Desktop base directory" spec (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/basedir-spec)
- adopt CMake or create autotools set of scripts to make build system portable (now it is hardcoded for Mac Os X)

notes:
a practical reason for automake (automatic generation of Makefile) is that on
different platforms, extension of shared library files may differ. For example
in Linux it is "so" and on Mac it is "dylib" and if your program creates shared
libraries you should use a variable specifying an extension for your librarie's
filename because linker will search for files with this specific extension. Of
course you can use a variable in your Makefile but this will look like a mess,
and now I can imagine there are more reasons to use automake. But.. this is
ridiculous, it's syntax is weird, tooooo old-school.
